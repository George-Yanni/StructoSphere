Primitive Data Types:
Primitive data types are the fundamental building blocks of data representation in programming languages. These types define the basic units of storage and computation, providing a foundation for more complex data structures. Below are some of the most commonly used primitive types:

Boolean:
A Boolean type represents a truth value and can hold one of two possible states: true or false. This type is widely used in logical expressions, decision-making structures, and control flow mechanisms.

Character:
The character type stores single textual symbols, such as letters, digits, or special characters. Typically, characters are represented using standards like ASCII or Unicode, ensuring compatibility across different systems.

Floating-Point Numbers:
Floating-point types are used to represent real numbers with decimal precision. They are essential for scientific calculations, graphics processing, and simulations. Common standards include:

Single-Precision (32-bit IEEE 754 float)/

Double-Precision (64-bit IEEE 754 float): These formats allow efficient computation while maintaining accuracy within a finite range.

Fixed-Point Representation:
Unlike floating-point numbers, fixed-point representation stores numbers with a fixed number of decimal places. This format is useful in financial applications and embedded systems where precise decimal representation is necessary.

Integer:
The integer type directly represents whole numbers, either positive, negative, or zero. Some variations include:

Signed Integers, which include both positive and negative values.

Unsigned Integers, which only store non-negative values, allowing for a larger positive range.

Reference (Pointer/Handle):
A reference is a value that refers to another location in memory. Unlike direct value storage, references allow efficient manipulation of complex structures by storing memory addresses instead of duplicating large data objects.

Symbol:
A symbol is a unique identifier that remains constant throughout program execution. Unlike strings, symbols are immutable and efficiently compared by reference rather than by value.

Enumerated Type (Enum):
An enumerated type defines a set of named values, often representing distinct states or categories. Enums improve code readability and maintainability by providing meaningful labels instead of arbitrary numeric codes.

Complex Numbers:
A complex type represents numbers consisting of both real and imaginary components, commonly used in scientific computations and signal processing. They follow the general form:

ùëß=ùëé+ùëèùëñ
where a is the real part, b is the imaginary part, and i is the imaginary unit.

Each primitive type serves a unique role in computation, influencing the efficiency and precision of data processing in programming. Understanding these types is fundamental for constructing robust and efficient software.
