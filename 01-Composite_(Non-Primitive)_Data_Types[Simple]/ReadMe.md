Composite data types, also known as non-primitive types, are built using primitive data types and allow more complex data structures to be created. These types provide a way to group multiple values together in meaningful ways, making data organization and manipulation more efficient.

1. Array
An array is a collection of elements of the same type, stored contiguously in memory. Arrays provide fast access to elements using an index and are commonly used for storing sequences of values.

2. Record (Structure or Struct)
A record is a data structure that groups multiple fields, each potentially of a different type, into a single entity.

3. Product Type (Tuple)
A product type, also called a tuple, is a structure where multiple values are combined, but fields are not explicitly named. 

4. String
A string is a sequence of characters representing text. Unlike primitive character arrays, modern programming languages provide string objects with built-in operations. 

5. Union
A union is a special data type where multiple variables share the same memory location. It is useful when a value could be of different types but only one type is needed at a time. 

6. Tagged Union (Variant or Discriminated Union)
A tagged union is a union with an additional field (tag) that specifies the type of data currently stored.
