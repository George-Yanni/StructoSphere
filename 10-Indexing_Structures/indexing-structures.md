# Indexing Structures

This document provides an overview of key indexing data structures used in computer science for efficient data retrieval, storage, and processing. These structures are widely applied in databases, text processing, networking, and cryptography. Each structure is described with its key features, use cases, and complexities, followed by a comparison table.

## B-Tree

### Description
A B-tree is a self-balancing tree designed for disk-based storage, with a high branching factor to minimize disk I/O. Each node stores multiple keys and pointers, maintaining balance to ensure efficient searches, insertions, and deletions.

### Key Features
- **Balanced**: Maintains logarithmic height for efficient operations.
- **High Fan-Out**: Nodes store many keys (e.g., hundreds), reducing tree height.
- **Disk-Optimized**: Minimizes disk reads/writes, ideal for large datasets.

### Use Cases
- **Databases**: Indexing in MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
- **File Systems**: NTFS, ext4, HFS+ for directory structures.
- **Key-Value Stores**: Efficient range queries and updates.

### Complexity
- **Search**: O(log n) (logarithmic with base proportional to node size).
- **Insert/Delete**: O(log n).
- **Space**: O(n), where n is the number of keys.

## Radix Tree (Patricia Trie)

### Description
A Radix Tree, also known as a Patricia Trie, is a compressed trie that stores keys by sharing common prefixes. It processes keys bit-wise or in character chunks, merging single-child nodes to save space.

### Key Features
- **Compressed**: Eliminates redundant nodes for memory efficiency.
- **Bit-Wise Processing**: Compares bits or character groups for branching.
- **Prefix-Based**: Ideal for prefix lookups and associative arrays.

### Use Cases
- **Networking**: IP routing tables, DNS resolvers.
- **Databases**: Sparse key storage in some NoSQL systems.
- **Text Processing**: Dictionary implementations with prefix queries.

### Complexity
- **Search**: O(k), where k is key length (independent of dataset size).
- **Insert/Delete**: O(k).
- **Space**: O(n * k), but compression reduces this significantly.

## Trie (Prefix Tree)

### Description
A Trie is a tree structure for storing strings or binary keys, where each node represents a character or bit. It excels at prefix-based lookups and is simple to implement.

### Key Features
- **Prefix-Centric**: Nodes store prefixes, enabling fast prefix queries.
- **Flexible**: Supports strings, binary data, or other sequences.
- **Simple Design**: Easy to implement for dictionary-like applications.

### Use Cases
- **Autocomplete**: Search suggestions in browsers or IDEs.
- **Spell Checkers**: Dictionary storage for word validation.
- **Routing Tables**: Prefix matching in networking.

### Complexity
- **Search**: O(k), where k is key length.
- **Insert/Delete**: O(k).
- **Space**: O(n * k) for n keys of average length k (less with compression).

## Suffix Array

### Description
A Suffix Array is an array-based structure storing indices of sorted suffixes of a string. It provides a space-efficient alternative to suffix trees for string matching and indexing.

### Key Features
- **Space-Efficient**: Uses less memory than suffix trees.
- **Sorted Suffixes**: Enables binary search for substring queries.
- **Companion Structures**: Often paired with LCP (Longest Common Prefix) arrays.

### Use Cases
- **Bioinformatics**: Genome indexing and sequence alignment.
- **Compression**: Burrows-Wheeler Transform in bzip2.
- **Full-Text Search**: Efficient substring queries in large texts.

### Complexity
- **Search**: O(m + log n) for a pattern of length m in a text of length n.
- **Construction**: O(n) with advanced algorithms (e.g., DC3).
- **Space**: O(n) for the array itself.

## FM-Index

### Description
The FM-Index is a compressed full-text index based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform. It enables fast substring searches with minimal memory, ideal for large datasets.

### Key Features
- **Compressed**: Stores large texts in space proportional to their entropy.
- **Fast Queries**: Supports substring matching via rank queries.
- **Burrows-Wheeler Based**: Leverages BWT for compression and search.

### Use Cases
- **Bioinformatics**: Sequence alignment (e.g., Bowtie, BWA).
- **Text Search**: Compressed full-text indexing in search engines.
- **Data Compression**: Efficient storage of repetitive texts.

### Complexity
- **Search**: O(m + log n) for a pattern of length m.
- **Construction**: O(n).
- **Space**: O(n / H), where H is text entropy (highly compressed).

## Merkle Tree

### Description
A Merkle Tree is a binary tree where leaf nodes store cryptographic hashes of data blocks, and parent nodes hash their children. It ensures data integrity and consistency in distributed systems.

### Key Features
- **Cryptographic**: Uses hashes for secure verification.
- **Efficient Verification**: Checks large datasets with logarithmic operations.
- **Binary Structure**: Simple and scalable for large data.

### Use Cases
- **Blockchain**: Transaction and state verification in Bitcoin, Ethereum.
- **Distributed Systems**: Data integrity in IPFS, Git.
- **Synchronization**: Efficient data consistency checks.

### Complexity
- **Verification**: O(log n) for checking a data block.
- **Construction**: O(n log n) for n data blocks.
- **Space**: O(n) for leaf nodes, O(log n) per proof.
