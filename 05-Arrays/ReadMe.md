# Bit Array (Bitset or Bit Vector)

A **bit array** (also known as a **bitset** or **bit vector**) is a data structure that efficiently stores a sequence of bits (0s and 1s). Each bit in a bit array can represent a simple true/false value, or it can be used to represent some other binary state or condition. A bit array is useful when you need to store a large number of binary values (such as flags, on/off states, or binary data) in a compact way, using minimal memory.

## Key Features of a Bit Array

### 1. Space Efficiency:
- A bit array uses just one bit for each element, unlike other data structures like arrays or lists, which usually store elements as whole bytes (8 bits per element).

### 2. Access Speed:
- You can access each bit in constant time (O(1)).

### 3. Memory:
- Bit arrays are highly memory efficient. For example, an array of 1,000 boolean values would take 1,000 bytes in a typical boolean array, but the same information can be stored in just 125 bytes in a bit array (since 8 bits = 1 byte).

## Use Cases

### 1. Flags:
- When you need to represent multiple boolean conditions (e.g., settings, options, or features), a bit array is perfect.

### 2. Bitmap Indexing:
- In databases or search engines, bit arrays are used to efficiently represent whether a particular item (like a word or a record) is present or not.

### 3. Compression:
- Bit arrays are often used for compressing data or representing binary files.

### 4. Low-level Operations:
- Bit-level manipulations, such as masking, shifting, and toggling, are very efficient when using a bit array.
