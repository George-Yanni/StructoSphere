1. Regular (Linear) Queue
A linear queue is a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

Key Characteristics:
Operations:

Enqueue (Insert): Adds an element at the rear.

Dequeue (Remove): Removes an element from the front.

Peek/Front: Returns the front element without removing it.

isEmpty/IsFull: Checks if the queue is empty or full.

Memory Usage:

Uses a linear storage structure (array or linked list).

Once elements are dequeued, the space is not reused.

Performance:

O(1) time complexity for enqueue/dequeue (if implemented efficiently).

Fixed size (if using an array) leads to memory wastage when elements are dequeued.

Disadvantages:
Memory wastage: Dequeued space is not reused.

Inefficient for large queues: Requires shifting elements or dynamic resizing.

2. Circular Queue
A circular queue (also called a ring buffer) is an optimized version of a linear queue where the rear and front wrap around to the start when they reach the end.

Key Characteristics:
Operations:

Enqueue: Adds an element at the rear, wrapping around if needed.

Dequeue: Removes an element from the front, wrapping around if needed.

Peek/Front: Returns the front element without removing it.

isEmpty/IsFull: Checks if the queue is empty or full.

Memory Usage:

Uses a fixed-size array but reuses empty spaces after dequeues.

No memory wastage (efficient for fixed-size buffers).

Performance:

O(1) time complexity for enqueue/dequeue.

Better memory utilization than a linear queue.

Advantages:
✔ No memory wastage (reuses dequeued space).
✔ Efficient for fixed-size buffers (e.g., CPU scheduling, traffic systems).
✔ Better performance than a linear queue when space is limited.

When to Use Which?
Use a Linear Queue:

When you need a simple FIFO structure.

When memory is not a constraint.

When you need dynamic resizing (e.g., using a linked list).

Use a Circular Queue:

When working with fixed-size buffers (e.g., CPU scheduling, printer queues).

When memory efficiency is crucial.

In real-time systems where space reuse is needed (e.g., traffic light control).

Final Thoughts
Circular queues are more efficient for fixed-size applications.

Linear queues are simpler but waste memory.

Choose based on your memory and performance needs.
