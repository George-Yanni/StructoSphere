This section explores Restricted Access Structures, a category of data structures where access to elements is deliberately constrained to enforce specific behaviors or optimize certain operations. Unlike general-purpose structures like arrays or linked lists, these structures limit how data can be added, removed, or retrieved, making them powerful tools for solving particular problems efficiently.

The focus here is on understanding the principles behind these structures, their implementations, and their real-world applications. The main structures covered include Stacks, Queues, Heaps, and additional related examples.
